# 02_PBLab – Problem-Based Learning LMS  
_Product-Requirements Document (PRD)_

## 1. Vision & Overview
PBLab is a lightweight, AI-augmented Learning-Management System that helps **students work in small teams on problem-based learning (PBL) projects** and lets **educators facilitate, observe, and assess** their progress.  
Instead of static assignments, PBLab structures work into the classic PBL cycle:

1. Pre-discussion → Problem statement & learning goals  
2. Self-directed research & artifact creation  
3. Post-discussion → Findings, reflection & report  

PBLab stores all metadata, workflow states and comments in a relational database (Supabase/Postgres) while **leveraging Google Docs/Slides/Sheets links for rich artifacts**. LLM tools are embedded as first-class citizens (e.g. "deep research", "PBL tutor") to encourage *responsible* AI use.

It is highly recommeneded to conduct some research on the PBL process and how it can be best supported by software. You want to make something users would actually want to use and that provides value to them. We have included many suggestions, but doing this work is part of your development into an AI-first developer.

## 2. Personas
| Persona | Goals | Pain Points |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| **Student** | Understand the problem, split tasks, document findings, create cool deliverables | Disjoint tools, unclear expectations, fear of "AI = cheating" |
| **Educator / Facilitator** | Monitor teams, give feedback, grade fairly, promote critical thinking | No visibility into team process, enforce PBL process |
| **Course Admin** | Manage problems, cohorts, permissions | Manual setup each term |

---

## 3. User Stories (Happy-Path)
### 3.1 Students
1. _As a student_ I can **join a team** via invite link so that I can collaborate on a PBL problem.  
2. I can **read the official problem description** and **propose a problem statement** with learning goals (Markdown or Google Doc link).  
3. I can **upload or link artifacts** (images, videos, docs, code repos) under a research phase.  
4. I can **tag teammates on comments** to discuss artifacts asynchronously.  
5. I can **use the "AI PBL tutor"** to brainstorm learning goals or get critique on my reflection, with usage logged for transparency.  
6. I can **submit the final report link** and mark the project "Ready for review".

### 3.2 Educators
1. _As an educator_ I can **create a new PBL problem**, defining title, description, and rubric.  
2. I can **view dashboards** of teams, their current phase, and pending questions.  
3. I can **leave rubric-based feedback** on the final report and lock the project.

### 3.3 Course Admin
1. _As an admin_ I can **add/remove users, create cohorts**, and assign educators to problems.

## 4. Key Features & MVP Cut-Lines
| Feature | MVP? | Notes |
|---------|------|-------|
| Team & Role management | ✅ | Students, Educators, Admins |
| Problem lifecycle states (Pre / Research / Post / Closed) | ✅ | State machine in DB |
| AI PBL tutor enforces PBL process| ✅ | Calls OpenAI / Gemini function |
| Artifact upload & metadata | ✅ | File to Supabase Storage OR external URL |
| Comment threads & mentions | ✅ | Simple per-artifact thread |
| Google Docs/Slides/Sheets link handling | ✅ | Detect & embed previews |
| Dashboard for educators | ✅ | Table / Kanban view |
| Feedback & basic rubric | ✅ | Per-criterion 1-5 rating + comment |
| Real-time presence / typing | ❌ (stretch) | Could reuse Project 3 code |
| Video/voice chat | ❌ | Out of scope |

---

## 5. Technical Decisions
| Area | Decision | Rationale |
|------|----------|-----------|
| **Stack** | Next.js (App Router) scaffolded by **V0** → edited in **Cursor** | Consistent with course workflow |
| **DB** | **Supabase Postgres** with Prisma (optional) | SQL clarity; built-in auth & storage |
| **Local Dev** | Supabase in **Docker Compose**; `npm run dev` for Next.js | One-command setup |
| **Auth** | Supabase email-link auth; RBAC via RLS policies | Fast, secure |
| **Hosting** | Vercel (app) + Supabase cloud |Minimal infrastructure complexity |
| **AI** | OpenAI functions via serverless route `/api/ai/*`; usage logged in `ai_usage` table | Simple, auditable |
| **Integrations** | Google OAuth scopes limited to Drive read-only for file metadata | Avoids storing large files |

## 7. Built-In AI-First Example Problems. 

Pre-populated your app with two example problems. If you want to impress the reviewers, think about how you can improve the app to fascilitate students to get the most out of the PBL process. It's not about making everything easier for the students, but increasing motivation to engage in the PBL process and making them creators of their own learning instead of just consumers.

### 7.1 "Outbreak Simulator" (Epidemiology)
| Item | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Problem Desc.** | A mysterious pathogen emerges in a city. Model its spread and propose containment strategies. |
| **Deliverable** | A playable web simulation (SIR model) + report comparing R₀ under interventions. |
| **Learning Goals** (sample) | • Understand SIR equations • Implement basic differential equations in JS • Interpret R₀ • Evaluate vaccination vs. quarantine |
| **Artifacts** | Google Sheet with data, code repo link, demo GIF |
| **AI Coach Prompts** | "Suggest parameter ranges for an airborne virus", "Explain R₀ to a 12-year-old" |

### 7.2 "EcoBalance" (Predator-Prey Ecology)
| Item | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Problem Desc.** | Design a simple ecosystem where predators and prey reach dynamic equilibrium. Adjust variables to prevent extinction. |
| **Deliverable** | Interactive Lotka-Volterra simulation + reflective essay on sustainability parallels. |
| **Learning Goals** | • Implement predator-prey equations • Visualize populations over time • Identify tipping points |
| **Artifacts** | Time-series charts, short explainer video, code link |
| **AI Coach Prompts** | "Derive Lotka-Volterra from first principles", "Suggest UX to show population collapse" |

## 8. Tests-to-Pass (Sample Acceptance Criteria)
| ID | Test | How to Verify |
|----|------|---------------|
| **T-01** | Student can create team via UI and invite peer via email. | E2E test: create → invite → peer accepts → team appears in dashboard. |
| **T-02** | PBL AI helper returns feedback but doesn't do the work for the student; logs usage. | Jest unit: mock OpenAI → assert DB `ai_usage` row. |
| **T-03** | Artifact upload enforces file-type whitelist. | API test: upload `.exe` → 400 error. |
| **T-04** | Educator feedback locks project editing. | E2E: add feedback → check inputs disabled. |

## 9. Quick-Start Guide
1. Create UI scaffold and API routes for the MVP in v0
2. Clone repo, open in **Cursor** → run `npm install, npm run dev`
3. `docker compose up supabase` for local DB
4. Copy `.env.example` → `.env.local`, add Supabase keys & OpenAI key. 
5. Push to GitHub → Vercel import → environment variables → **Deploy**
6. Create and run seed script `npm db:seed` to create sample problems & users

## 11. Open Questions
1. Should rubric scoring be numeric, qualitative, or both?  
2. How granular must AI usage logs be for academic integrity?  
3. Do we require offline/real-time sync (CRDT) for simultaneous editing?
4. How can we best support the PBL process?

## 12. Out-of-Scope for MVP
- Full LMS grade-book & attendance  
- Real-time collaborative document editing (delegated to Google Docs)  
- Mobile-native app (responsive web only for MVP)  
- Push notifications
