# 02_PBLab ‚Äì Problem-Based Learning LMS  
_Product-Requirements Document (PRD)_

## 1. Vision & Overview
PBLab is a lightweight, AI-augmented Learning-Management System that helps **students work in small teams on problem-based learning (PBL) projects** and lets **educators facilitate, observe, and assess** their progress.  
Instead of static assignments, PBLab structures work into the classic PBL cycle:

1. Pre-discussion ‚Üí Problem statement & learning goals  
2. Self-directed research & artifact creation  
3. Post-discussion ‚Üí Findings, reflection & report  

PBLab stores all metadata, workflow states and comments in a relational database (Supabase/Postgres) while **leveraging Google Docs/Slides/Sheets links for rich artifacts**. LLM tools are embedded as first-class citizens (e.g. ‚Äúdraft learning goals‚Äù, ‚Äúcritique my reflection‚Äù) to encourage *responsible* AI use.

The project replaces the original ‚ÄúCRMagic‚Äù MVP.  It remains a **multi-user CRUD app with complex but approachable data structures**, fulfilling the same scope while feeling mission-driven and modern.

## 2. Personas
| Persona | Goals | Pain Points |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| **Student** | Understand the problem, split tasks, document findings, create cool deliverables | Disjoint tools, unclear expectations, fear of ‚ÄúAI = cheating‚Äù |
| **Educator / Facilitator** | Monitor teams, give feedback, grade fairly, promote critical thinking | No visibility into team process, plagiarism worries |
| **Course Admin** | Manage problems, cohorts, permissions | Manual setup each term |

---

## 3. User Stories (Happy-Path)
### 3.1 Students
1. _As a student_ I can **join a team** via invite link so that I can collaborate on a PBL problem.  
2. I can **read the official problem description** and **propose a problem statement** with learning goals (Markdown or Google Doc link).  
3. I can **upload or link artifacts** (images, videos, docs, code repos) under a research phase.  
4. I can **tag teammates on comments** to discuss artifacts asynchronously.  
5. I can **use the ‚ÄúAI Coach‚Äù** to brainstorm learning goals or get critique on my reflection, with usage logged for transparency.  
6. I can **submit the final report link** and mark the project ‚ÄúReady for review‚Äù.

### 3.2 Educators
1. _As an educator_ I can **create a new PBL problem**, defining title, description, and rubric.  
2. I can **view dashboards** of teams, their current phase, and pending questions.  
3. I can **leave rubric-based feedback** on the final report and lock the project.

### 3.3 Course Admin
1. _As an admin_ I can **add/remove users, create cohorts**, and assign educators to problems.

## 4. Key Features & MVP Cut-Lines
| Feature | MVP? | Notes |
|---------|------|-------|
| Team & Role management | ‚úÖ | Students, Educators, Admins |
| Problem lifecycle states (Pre / Research / Post / Closed) | ‚úÖ | State machine in DB |
| Learning-goal editor + AI ‚ÄúSuggestion‚Äù button | ‚úÖ | Calls OpenAI / Gemini function |
| Artifact upload & metadata | ‚úÖ | File to Supabase Storage OR external URL |
| Comment threads & mentions | ‚úÖ | Simple per-artifact thread |
| Google Docs/Slides/Sheets link handling | ‚úÖ | Detect & embed previews |
| Dashboard for educators | ‚úÖ | Table / Kanban view |
| Feedback & basic rubric | ‚úÖ | Per-criterion 1-5 rating + comment |
| Real-time presence / typing | ‚ùå (stretch) | Could reuse Project 3 code |
| Video/voice chat | ‚ùå | Out of scope |

## 5. Technical Decisions
| Area | Decision | Rationale |
|------|----------|-----------|
| **Stack** | Next.js (App Router) scaffolded by **V0** ‚Üí edited in **Cursor** | Consistent with course workflow |
| **DB** | **Supabase Postgres** with Prisma (optional) | SQL clarity; built-in auth & storage |
| **Local Dev** | Supabase in **Docker Compose**; `npm run dev` for Next.js | One-command setup |
| **Auth** | Supabase email-link auth; RBAC via RLS policies | Fast, secure |
| **Hosting** | Vercel (app) + Supabase cloud | Matches Project 1 |
| **AI** | OpenAI functions via serverless route `/api/ai/*`; usage logged in `ai_usage` table | Simple, auditable |
| **Integrations** | Google OAuth scopes limited to Drive read-only for file metadata | Avoids storing large files |

## 11. Open Questions
1. Should rubric scoring be numeric, qualitative, or both?  
2. How granular must AI usage logs be for academic integrity?  
3. Do we require offline/real-time sync (CRDT) for simultaneous editing?  
4. Accessibility (a11y) checklist for student-created artifacts?
