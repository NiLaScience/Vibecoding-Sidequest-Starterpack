# Vibecoding Starter Pack  
*AIâ€‘First Development, distilled to the essentials*

---

Go from vibecoder to AI-first developer. Guaranteed results.

Top project submission gets paid $250 each month on Sidequests.gg

## 0Â Â Why This Course Exists  

The \#1 reason why other courses fail is because they waste your time with theoretical lessons and exercises, instead of spending 90% of your time building.

This course is different!

The goal of this course is simple: to get you paid as fast as possible. Be that by getting a job in a company, joining a startup, or turning a side project into a real business.

This course is by far the fastest way to go from some coding knowledge but little to no development experience to a full portfolio of deployed projects with actual users. 

This will serve as proof-of-competence to potential employers, cofounders, investors, and your online audience.

It's designed to turn the gap between tutorials and shipping into a sprint:

* **Five progressively harder sidequests** (PromptLibrary â†’ VidTutor) that build realâ€‘world products.
* **Guides** that show how to orchestrate AI agents instead of writing every line yourself.
* **A learningâ€‘goal matrix** to help you build **proof of competence** you can actually show employers.

Ship â†’ reflect â†’ ship again. That's the loop.

## 2Â Â What You Need Before You Start  

| Account / Tool | Why |
|---------------|-----|
| **Replit** | Zeroâ€‘toâ€‘CRUD cloud IDE + Agent (Project 01) |
| **Vercel v0** | Promptâ€‘toâ€‘UI generator (Projects 02â€‘03) |
| **Cursor *or* Windsurf IDE** | Local AIâ€‘powered editor for serious refactors |
| **GitHub** | Repo hosting, PRs, portfolio proof |
| **OpenAI / Gemini / Anthropic API keys** | The projects call GenAI endpoints |
| *(Optional)* **Supabase** cloud org | Postgres + storage used in Projects 02â€‘03 |

*Tip:* Keep all keys in a `.env.local` and **never** commit them.

## 3Â Â How to Get Started (10â€‘Minute Sprint)  

1. **Fork** this repo â†’ `gh repo fork ...`  
2. **Open Project 01**: `projects/01_PromptLibrary.md` (skim scope)  
3. Paste the PRD into an LLM and discuss the project. Then build a prompt of 30 lines or less that describes 80% of UI features.
4. Spin up Replit Agentâ†’ Paste your prompt, watch the agent build.
5. Iterate a few times until you are happy with the first draft, then hit deploy.
6. Download the code, open the repo in Cursor and ask: "Explain the folder structure."  
7. Create `notes/learning_reflection.md` and log what you just learned.

That's the pattern you'll repeatâ€”only the tech and complexity change.

## 5  The Vibecoding Loop  

1. **Absorb the PRD**  
   *Skim the vision, user stories & cutâ€‘lines.*  
2. **Phase the Work**  
   Split the PRD into 2â€‘toâ€‘4 hour "miniâ€‘milestones" (UI scaffold, DB schema, auth, etc.).  
3. **Checklist It**  
   Drop a *Planning Prompt* into your agent:  
4. **Agentic Execution**  
Let the agent tackle each unchecked box. Intervene, test, commit.  
5. **Deploy Early**  
Replit "Deploy", Vercel Preview, Firebase Hostingâ€”whatever ships fastest.  
6. **Reflect & Map**  
After each milestone open `learning_goals.md` and mark which bullets you *actually* touched. Jot a quick note or screenshot.  
7. **Rinse & Repeat**  

```
