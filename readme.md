This repo is the starting point for a course on AI-first development for people with some coding experience but no development or product experience. It will consist of a fairly exhaustive lists of full-stack web development learning goals, a set of five projects designed to cover the learning goals, a tooling and workflow guide, and a series of videos covering the projects and guides.

We want to teach people how to build things from scratch.
It should make it as easy as possible to go from some coding, but 0 building products, to the first MVP.

It should cover basic tooling and architecture principles.
It should not be overly long at any point. Focus on learning by doing.
Focus on failing.

Emphasize checklists, emphasize deployment over testing.
Emphasizes low barrier to entry tooling.

Emphasis question and curiosity based learning.

We have compiled a list of questions that users should be able to answer after completing the projects.
We can provide some brief guides to help them answer the questions, but we won't provide the answers.
The best way to learn is to start building, run into issues, learn to deal with them, fail again, and then succeed.

We will teach some details on AI-first development and give basic guidance on workflow, tooling, and best practices.
We will create PRD documents for the first three projects, and create a guide on how to create PRD documents for the rest of the projects.

The basic workflow consists of building a UI prototype from the PRD using v0, replit, lovable, that covers ~ 80% of the UI functionality. Either in React + Vite or Next.js. This is then downloaded and used as a template for the actual project.
The basic backend features and connections should be built automatically using AI, by creating checklists of features and then using the checklist to build the backend. We don't want to over emphasize testing, but we do want to emphasize deployment and CI/CD. 

PRDs should focus on user stories, features, and give guidance on key technical decisions. The users should nontheless have a lot of freedom to make decisions. We do not want to over-specify the projects, but we do want to give them a good starting point. No timelines, no strict testing requirements, no strict metrics. Features, users stories, guidance on technical decisions, a few tests-to-pass. And a quickstart guide on which templates to use, etc.

We need to create learning goals for each project and emphasizes how key technical decisions affect which challenges and learnings the user will face.

For the last two projects, users have to create their own PRDs. We only provide background, basic feature sets, and a quickstart guide on which templates to use, etc. In these projects, they should cover the learning goals for project management, architecting, user feedback, etc.
