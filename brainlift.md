# **SideQuests - Proof of Competence in the AI Era**

## **Owner:** Nils Lang

## **Purpose**

To articulate and develop a framework for a platform establishing new, trustworthy "proofs of competence" through real-world challenges (**sidequests**) in verifiable domains. This platform aims to bridge the growing gap between traditional credentials and actual skills, creating a vital **golden bridge** pathway between institutional compliance and high-risk entrepreneurship, enabling more talented individuals to demonstrate capability, acquire valuable skills, secure meaningful work, and create impact in an AI-transformed economy. It also serves as a **value compass** that points towards remaining areas of high real-world value that companies are willing to put up bounties for. For companies, it provides means to **crowdsource intelligence** for their highest-value technical bottlenecks by putting up **bounties** on their solution, as well as providing new hiring funnels for individuals who have obtained **proof of competence** in high value domains. **Bounty-as-a-Service (BaaS)** – handling the administrative, legal, financial, and promotional complexities of running challenges for businesses provides a low-friction service for business to post Sidequests and for the smartest people to rise to the top quickly. Benchmarking compute/inference cost alongside performance, handling data security/obfuscation, and progressive resource deployment for verified progress on their problems provide relevant benefits for clients compared to competitors. 

## **Value Proposition**

**Users** 

**Value Compass**: Which skills remain relevant as AI progresses

**Bounties**: Use your frontier expertise to make impact and earn rewards

**Proof of Competence**: Proof ability and achievement on high-value problems

**Problem-based Learning**: Leverage AI to break down big problems into workable learning pathways that stay oriented towards progress on the big task

**Businesses**

**De-risking Innovation (pay for outcomes). **

**Handling Challenge Complexity (BaaS)** – we take care of the setup, legal, payments, promotion.

**Cost-Efficiency Benchmarking** (evaluate solutions not just on performance but also on inference/compute cost).

**Enhanced Data Security** Options (obfuscation methods).

**Talent Pool Expansion**: **Sidequests** with significant reward will grow the number of people with relevant skills faster than any other solution

**Crowdsource Intelligence**: source solutions for high-value technical bottlenecks from otherwise inaccessible talent

**Replace broken hiring pipelines**: leverage **proofs of competence** rather than traditional credentials in a rapidly evolving world of AI

**Progressive resource deployment**: unlock capex step by step as a problem is being solved, rather than providing a yearly headcount and budget without guarantees of progress

## **DOK4 - Spiky POVs**

- **S1: Proof of Competence > Proof of Compliance:** In a rapidly changing, AI-accelerated world, demonstrated capability through real-world challenges is more valuable and trustworthy than traditional credentials based on compliance.
  - **Myth**: the dean of my college told me: “80% of life is just showing up”
  - **Truth**: in a world rapidly transformed by AI, it is a conscious choice to stay at the frontier of high-value skills and areas of expertise
  - Sources: I1, I6, I12
- **S2: The Golden Bridge is Essential:** The missing third path between institutional conformity ("tuck in") and high-risk entrepreneurship ("drop out") is crucial for unlocking potential in millions of capable individuals who lack extreme risk tolerance.
  - **Myth**: only 99th percentile in IQ, risk-taking, disagreeableness, creativity can make an impact by dropping out of college
  - **Truth**: by providing a clear reward function, we can 10x the number of people making direct impacts through technological, scientific, and business innovation
  - Sources: I8
- **S3: Unlocking Vastly More Talent:** Current educational and employment systems artificially constrain the talent pool through outdated gatekeeping; a challenge-based system can identify and mobilize at least 10x more talent capable of solving frontier problems.
  - **Myth**: You need to spend 4-8 years at one of a handful of universities to become and expert in AI/ML, robotics, aerospace, integrated systems engineering, etc
  - **Truth**: Problem-based learning provides an accelerated, streamlined path to slightly narrower but much more applicable skill sets in high-value domains, independent of institutional credibility or location.
  - Sources: I5, I9
- **S4: Real-World Challenges as the Only True Signal:** Successfully completing real-world challenges, especially those with financial stakes (bounties), is the only reliable and cheat-proof signal of competence in an era where AI can fake traditional credentials and assessments.
  - **Myth**: A generalist college degree is the ideal preparation for a high-value, high-impact career.
  - **Truth**: What companies are willing to pay for specific skills and problem-solving provides a more accurate and responsive "**Value Compass**" than any educational institution's curriculum.
  - Sources: I7, I12
- **S5: Reward Function Realignment is Critical:** Swapping the reward function from credential acquisition to demonstrated capability is the single most powerful lever for unlocking human potential and aligning incentives with real-world value creation.
  - **Myth**: Gen Z is lazy and unambitious, they use AI to cheat on exams and are constantly burned out on the job because they are spoiled and weak.
  - **Truth**: College degrees and bullshit job paychecks are pieces of paper that do not provide significant motivational value. Young people care about having an impact in the world. A truly merit-based reward function that unlocks resources based on progress in high value domains can turn Gen Z into the most productive generation ever.
  - Sources: I3, I11
- **S6: Traditional Evaluation Systems are Fundamentally Broken:** Credential-based hiring died when colleges started softening admissions, tech goes through layoff waves and AI cuts halflife of skills; they require replacement with proof of competence and proof of achievement-based models.
  - **Myth**: college admissions, exams, as well as past employment and skill assessments in the hiring process are sufficient proofs of ability and predict performance on the job. Best practices are best learned through gradual exposure to real world problems and persist over time.
  - **Truth**: AI enables cheating and all previous assessments and 10-year old technical expertise is useless in the changing world of AI. The most direct way to convert your IQ to cash is to prove adaptness at the most current tools by solving frontier-level challenges in public.
  - Sources: I1, I2, I4, I11
- **S7: High Social & Psychological Costs of Misalignment:** Career instability and loss of status due to AI displacement of jobs represents a massive societal opportunity cost, threatening stability and innovation as AI advances. Agency inducing AI collaboration lets people rise with the tide instead of tying them to the ocean floor.
  - **Myth**: Traditional degrees and careers provide a high level of social integration and security, as well as a life filled with meaning. People need career stability and society must deliver it.
  - **Truth**: AI anxiety is caused by low agency and lack of experience in human-AI collaboration. Low stakes platforms that train people in applying AI to real world problems and leveraging their unique AI force multiplies will increase productivity instead of social disruption.
  - Sources: I3, I9, I11
- **S8: Companies that don't crowdsource intelligence fall behind:** Keeping up in the AI armsrace either requires talent pipelines to a few hundred grads per year (impossible for 90% of businesses), or sourcing solutions from a global marketplace based on real-world value of problems. 
  - **Myth**: In-house experts, long term strategy, and traditional consulting services provide all the brainpower needed to adapt your business model and operations in the AI era.
  - **Truth: **Sourcing intelligence from rare external domain experts on merit-based platforms provides a cost effective solution. By using AI to create verifiable benchmarks for submitted solutions, this marketplace of ideas can be agnostic to tools and traditional credentials.
  - Sources: I5, I10
- **S9: The Recruiting AI arms race: **hiring managers are being flooded with AI generated CVs, candidates are applying for 10x more positions. Proof of competence based hiring is the only way to escape the AI arms race.
  - **Myth: **By upgrading the ATS/recruiting tech stack to include more filters, AI interviewing agents, and more nuanced evaluations companies can keep up with the growing spam in their hiring pipelines.
  - **Truth: **Candidates will always be a step ahead in the AI arms race. Proof of competence based hiring using sidequests is tool agnostic and encourages use of AI tools if they lead to better outcomes. This way, you keep your hiring pipeline clean while enriching for AI talent.
  - Sources: I4, I7, I11
- **S10: Accuracy is overrated in ML competitions**: most companies care way more about not exposing their valuable datasets and saving on compute costs than gaining 0.1 percent on AUC to get on top of the leaderboard. 
  - **Myth: **All that matters in ML is squeezing out the absolute maximum performance from the dataset, this is how you create maximum business value.
  - **Truth: Cost & privacy are the new leaderboard. **Companies care a lot about managing their running costs and are willing to trade off performance for compute savings. By integrating this into our benchmark, sidequests re-aligns the incentives of clients and users. Training on un-obfuscated data is always a security risk, as training data can be reverse engineered from model weights or even just model usage.
  - Sources: I13, I14
- **S11: Friction kills marketplaces: **Concerns around KYC, IP, and legal constraints, not lack of relevant problems is the bounty killer. **Bounty as a Service **creates the missing low-friction operator layer that takes those issues off of customers minds.
  - **Myth:** Just put prize money on the Internet and brilliant strangers will solve your problem. If few bounties get posted, demand must be low. Tough problems will filter out the talent that can make submission, benchmarks handle the rest.
  - **Truth: **Business execs have to avoid risk at all cost. If they carry KYC/IP/legal risk themselves, they will never use bounties to drive innovation. A BaaS layer that ships pre-templatized scopes, click-thru contracts, licensed escrow, global payouts, secure auto-grading, and launch-marketing liquefies frozen R &D budgets into live sidequests can unlocking 100× more challenges based on reputation and earning SaaS-style take-rates on every dollar that clears the marketplace. 
  - Sources: I14, I18
- **S12:** **Focus Beats Firehose: **Past marketplaces failed because they a) could not attrack enough talent or b) could not evaluate submissions efficiently. By launching a few high value challenges from within Trilogy in a veryfiable and highly attractive domain(AI/ML), Sidequests can create success stories and scale based on reputation.
  - **Myth:** The broader the marketplace, the more talent you attract—let anyone post any problem and solutions will fly in. There are bootstrappable ways to evaluate solutions to almost any problem by involving the community. 
  - **Truth:** Generalist bounty bazaars fractured and died ([Prizes.org](http://prizes.org/), Bounties Network) because network effects stall without a shared language for quality. Domain-focused hubs—security (HackerOne), ML benchmarks (Kaggle), DeFi exploits (Immunefi)—proved that tight vertical curation concentrates expertise, lifts trust, and 10×’s solution rates.
  - Sources: I15, I16, I17
- **S13: Benchmark-first problem solving: **When best practices break down and the solution space is exploding, investing in proper benchmarks for what constitutes a valid solution to a problem is the most efficient use of resources. Bounties and crowdsourced intelligence then act as the optimization algorithm for the benchmark.
  - **Myth:** Finding a solution to a problem once and then adapting it to respond to a changing environment is a valid way to keep up with innovation. In-house teams work on problem solving and use external vendors and tools to monitor and update according to a changing environment.
  - **Truth: **To operate efficiently and with low latency wrt AI advances, in- house teams should focus on defining problems and creating benchmarks that can measure how good solutions are. By putting a bounty on the benchmark, hundreds of smart people around the world will work on solving your problems for you. This is the mechanism by which AI has been progressing so fast.
- **S14: Most people are no longer resource-constrained, they are incentive-constrained. **AI tools will level the playing field of how much impact a single human with limited means can have on the world. Nonetheless, we won't unlock all that potential for progress unless we provide proper incentives and low-friction pathways for smart people to work on tough problems. 
  - **Myth: **Material constraints were the main reason why only few people used to work on hard frontier problems. Just by having access to the force-multiplying technology of AI, people will be motivated to live to their full potential. 
  - **Truth: **AI can be both a force multiplier and a weapon of mass distraction. Incentive structures decide which one applies to a given person. Piece-of-paper (credential, wage) based incentives are less effective than merit and impact oriented incentives (bounty, recognition, pioneering).

## **DOK3 - Insights**

- **I1: Crisis of Credential Trust:** Traditional credentials (elite colleges, degrees, work history) are rapidly losing employer trust as reliable signals of actual, current competence, creating confusion and market failure in talent identification.
  - Sources:  I.2, I.3, I.6, I.8
- **I2: Education-Employment Disconnect:** Educational institutions are structurally unable to keep pace with changing skill demands, focusing primarily on signaling rather than effective skill development, leading to systemic inefficiency and underemployment even for graduates.
  - Sources: I.3, I.4, I.5, I.6, I.11
- **I3: The Limiting Binary Choice:** The forced choice between rigid institutional paths and high-risk entrepreneurship excludes a vast cohort of talented individuals who could thrive with structured, real-world challenges and intermediate risk profiles. If we can build the golden bridge to soften the environmental, risk-taking, and disagreeableness requirements to the 80th percentile we unlock 100x the talent
  - Sources: III.7
- **I4: AI's Dual Impact:** AI advancements are simultaneously 1) devaluing routine cognitive skills verifiable by traditional means *and* 2) providing tools that could enable more effective, personalized, challenge-based learning and verification.
  - Sources: II.1, II.3, II.5

**I5: Colleges Are Failing With AI: **Noticing students using AI tools for their assignments, most colleges react by banning these tools. This gives students the choice of a) not learning how to use the most powerful tools out there or b) being discredited as cheaters. Outcome oriented education and evaluation frameworks are agnostic to the tools used and enable learners to stay at the cutting edge.

Sources:  I.10, I.11, I.12

- **I6: Superiority of Challenge-Based Learning:** Real-world problem-solving provides better learning outcomes (retention, transferability, skill development) and more reliable skill verification than artificial assessments or passive learning methods. This has long been known, even in academia with problem-based learning frameworks, however, they are underutilized because they do not actually require Professors to run and are purely dependent on the motivation and intelligence of the students.
  - Sources: III.1, III.3, V.1, V.3
- **I7: Current Hiring Ineffectiveness:** Hiring processes relying on proxies (degrees, pedigree) rather than direct skill assessment result in both false positives and false negatives, failing to identify truly capable candidates. Additionally, skill assessments such as Leetcode exams in software hiring are rendered ineffective by AI cheating tools.
  - Sources: I.2, I.6, I.8
- **I8: Psychological and Social Toll:** The prevalence of meaningless work, job insecurity, and unclear career paths stemming from misaligned systems creates widespread anxiety, erodes social cohesion, and negatively impacts attitudes toward technological progress.
  - Sources: I.8, I.9
- **I9: Community and Network Effects:** Challenge-based learning naturally fosters communities of practice—groups where people collaborate, share expertise, and learn together—accelerating skill development and network building beyond what isolated educational experiences offer.
  - Sources: III.1, III.2
- **I10: Artificial Scarcity:** The disconnect between education and employment creates artificial scarcity in high-demand fields despite a large pool of potentially capable individuals who lack the "right" credentials.
  - Sources: I.3, I.4, III.3
- **I11: Reward Hacking:** Cheating and reduced motivation of college students and people in low-impact (“bullshit”) jobs is unsurprising, as it is generally acknowledged in motivational and behavioral science that subjects will try to find the most efficient way to optimize the objective function of their environment. In fact, this could be seen as a signal for resourcefulness. Switching the reward function to a merit-based, high reward ladder that can be climbed by proving learning and achievement will solve these problems.
  - Sources:  IV.2, IV.3, IV.4

**I12: Undervalued Bounties: **Bounties on platforms like Kaggle and Replit significantly undervalue crowdsourced intelligence. Top ML challenges offer ~$1M, roughly the cost of 1-2 engineers, but demand far greater results and still attract hundreds of submissions. Similarly, Replit bounties often pay less than freelance rates. This highlights crowdsourcing's power to deliver complex solutions cost-effectively, especially since bounties, unlike freelance or employee pay, are tied directly to successful outcomes rather than time invested.

Sources: VI.4, VI.8

**I13:  Accuracy/performance is only one aspect of AI/ML: **[Openpipe.ai](http://openpipe.ai/) built a whole business on retraining open source models to give better costs and latency with only a slight drop in accuracy. Finetuned versions of Llama and other open source models are capturing significant market share for this reason.

Sources:  II.7, II.8

**I14 — Friction-Removal Flywheel ** Compliance as the hidden moat**: **Procurement delays, KYC/AML, IP clauses, and payout rails—not prize pools—block companies from posting challenges; a BaaS layer that bundles licensed escrow, templated contracts, safe-harbor, finance ops, and auto-grading can unlock 10× more live bounties. Previous failures show that regulatory plumbing (KYC, escrow, tax, contractor status) — not matchmaking or scoring — is the true choke-point. Now that turnkey fintech/KYC APIs exist, nailing this layer early creates a durable moat that generic tech clones can’t easily replicate.

Sources: VI.5, VI.7

- **I15 — Vertical First, Horizontal Later:** Platforms that start in a single verifiable lane (security, ML, DeFi) achieve critical mass and liquidity, while broad “anything-goes” bazaars collapse; Sidequests should launch deep, not wide, then expand once trust & evaluation standards are proven.
  - Sources: VI.1, VI.2, VI.3, VI.4
- **I16 — Seed liquidity with corporate-grade flagship bounties: **The only proven escape from the two-sided cold-start is to launch with a few eye-watering, institution-backed bounties that signal solvency and attract top solvers. Trilogy can finance or guarantee those first deals, giving Sidequests a structural advantage competitors lacked.
  - Sources: VI.4, VI.8
- **I17 — Pick a tribe before going broad: **Platforms that tried to be “bounties for everything” died; those that owned a passionate niche (security, crypto) live. Sidequests should start with a clearly defined high-agency student/early-career technical tribe, then expand outward once network effects kick in.
  - Sources: VI.1, VI.2, VI.3
- **I18 — Marketing = micro-automation: **The BountyCaster pattern (instantly converting “I need X” tweets into ready-to-sign bounty offers) proves that outbound automation can both acquire customers and teach them the posting UX. Re-tool this for $10 k+ corporate problems to create a perpetual top-of-funnel engine.
