### What is HTML? (The Skeleton)

**HTML** is like the robot's skeleton. It gives the robot its shape. It says, "here is the head, here are the two arms, here is the body, and here are the legs." On a webpage, HTML puts the big pieces in place, like a title at the top, a menu on the side, and a big space for text in the middle. It's the **structure**.

### What is CSS? (The Clothes and Colors)

**CSS** is like the robot's clothes, its paint color, and all the cool stickers you put on it. It makes the robot look good! Does the robot have blue eyes? Is it shiny red? Does it have racing stripes?

On a webpage, CSS handles all the colors, fonts, and spacing. It makes the text bigger, changes the button color to green, and puts a picture in the corner. It's the **style**.

### What is JavaScript? (The Brain)

**JavaScript** is like the robot's brain and engine. It makes the robot *do* things. When you press a button on the remote control, JavaScript is what makes the robot's arm wave, or makes its eyes light up, or makes it walk across the room.

On a webpage, JavaScript makes things happen. When you click a button and a new window pops up, that's JavaScript. When you see a slideshow of pictures, that's JavaScript. It makes the page **interactive**.

### What is [[What_is_TypeScript]]? (The Robot's Instruction Manual)

Imagine you're building a very, very complicated robot with lots of pieces.

**TypeScript** is like a special, super-clear instruction manual. Before you even turn the robot on, the manual tells you if you've put a leg piece where an arm piece should go. It helps you catch mistakes early so your robot works perfectly when you're done.

It's a helper for JavaScript that makes sure all your code pieces fit together correctly, which is really useful when your website gets big and complicated. It helps you write **safer** code.
