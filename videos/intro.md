Welcome to the Vibecoding Sidequest!
The only course on AI-first development that is exclusively designed to get you results as fast as possible.

More than 100 people in cohort 1 of Gauntlet AI used the exact principles in this course to go from zero AI-first development experience to receiving a 200k+ job offer in 3 months.

This course is going to allow anyone with some coding knowledge, but little to no experience building full-stack applications to build a portfolio of real-world applications faster than they ever thought possible.

And it all comes down to using AI to accelerate your learning and building.

In this video, I am going to introduce the framework that underlies this course, introduce you to all the content, and send you on your first Sidequest.

But first, to justify why you should stick with this course over any other courses or tutorials out there, I want to share with you the three traps most online and offline courses fall into.

Trap 1: The consumption trap. Almost all courses out there pretend their value comes from the content they provide. That's why they make you watch hours and hours of video lectures and tutorials, have you solve exercises, and complete tests. In my opinion, this is pure infotainment. Every second you spend consuming is not spend on the number 1 most effective way to learn anything: building. And learning science agrees. Project and problem based learning are by far the most effective ways to build new knowledge and skills. That's why, in this course, you will spend 90% of your time working on real projects, pushing your comfort zone and growing your skills every minute of every day.

Trap 2: Learning for the sake of learning. Since other courses don't make you build real projects, they teach you a big pile of materials, promising that some of them will become useful at some point. But the truth is, you will never use most of the things you learn. This is why, in this course, you will follow the principle of just in time learning. You will only spend time reading up on new concepts right when you need them to move forward with a given project. This also closes the theory-practice gap, since you will implement the concepts you learn right away. This is 10x more efficient then acquiring a very general education first, before even working on the first project with any real complexity.

Trap 3: The education sandbox. Most university and online courses provide you a safe space, where non of your work ever comes into contact with the real world. This means the only proof of what you did during this time is the certificate you get at the end. But the truth is: the value of credentials is declining rapidly in the AI era, as best practices and established standards are breaking down. Proof of competence through work that leaves a mark in the real world is the only true signal of your skills. This is why, in this course, you will be building real-world applications, try to acquire users, and document your learning and building online. Thus, you are building a portfolio of proofs-of-competence that you can share with potential employers, cofounders, or investors. Even more importantly, you will become part of a community of people building and learning in public, and new connections will lead to new opportunities.

If you are trying to pivot your career to ride the AI wave, or you want to jump a few steps on the career ladder, avoiding these three traps is crucial, since you will get results 10x faster than people following a traditional course.

Now without further ado, let's jump into the course.

As I have already alluded to, this is not a traditional video course. You are going to spend 90% of your time building and learning with AI. And if you want to, I think you could skip these videos entirely and just dive right into the first Sidequest. But I do think that that the tooling, workflow, and learning guides we put together will ease your transition into the world of AI-first development. 

The truth is, that people with 0 development experience often have an easier time getting started with AI-first development than people with 10 years of experience. And the reason is that, unless you follow a structured workflow and are using the right tools at the right time, you will get worse results building with AI than you would writing all code by hand.

But if you follow the workflow we are recommending, you will quickly be able to let AI write 90-100% of your code. And don't take my word for it, more than 100 people in cohort 1 of GauntletAI had exactly this experience.

So how does this course work? 
We have assembled a knowledge graph of the most important concepts in full-stack development in 2025. These are your learning goals. It's really the 80/20 of what you need to know to build real-world applications. Then, we distributed these learning goals across 5 projects, 5 real-world applications you are going to build, deploy, and document. These projects have increasing complexity, and decreasing levels of guidance. So your first two projects should be relatively straightforward to execute and let you quickly absorb the main concepts of frontend and backend development. From then on, you will be building more complex applications, and we will guide you through the process of using AI to build them and, more importantly, learning whatever concepts or skills you need to move forward independently.


We have prepared a workflow guide, a tooling guide, and a learning guide for the course.

The workflow guide will allow you to get guaranteed results from your AI-first development. It will guide you through the process of using AI to build your projects while avoiding all the mistakes that most people make when they start building with AI.

The tooling guide will allow you to speed up your development by using the right tools at the right time. While there is some freedom in choosing your tools, by following our recommendations, you will get and MVP for each project in less than a day: guaranteed. And you will avoid the two most common pitfalls of AI-first development: starting from a blank page, and blowing up your codebase over time.

The learning guide will allow you to learn the most important concepts and skills in full-stack development in a way that is most efficient for you. It will guide you through the process of learning by doing, document your learning, and use AI as your personal tutor that is much more effective than any other learning method.

Next, let's take a look at the five projects that will take you from zero to the cutting edge of AI-first development. If you manage to complete projects 4 and 5, you will be able to choose whether you want to take on a full-time job, or just take your MVPs and build them into a company. 

But obviously, we are starting out by easing you into the process with project 1, in which you will build an app to manage your personal prompt library that will serve you throughout the rest of the course. Using Replit agent, you will build the full protoype without even opening an IDE. Once you have built the frontend, you can ask Replit to connect it to a simple database and deploy the app. You will have put your first app out into the real world in less than 2h. Which other course will push you to do that? You can then choose to keep building out all the features of the app in Replit, or you can download the code and open it in windsurf, or our recommendation: cursor. Then it is learning time. By asking the AI to explain to project file structure, functionality implemented in the code, and the various elements of the tech stack and what their role is. Use you learning goals from the project 1 PRD to make sure you have understood at least the basics of each concept by the time you wrap up project one.

Projects 2 and 3 are going to be a bit more complex, you will have to start building in your IDE and use a few different services to implement the frontend and backend. Project 2 is building a problem based learning platform, where you can create and share learning challenges, similar to the vibecoding sidequest you are taking on right now. Project 3 is building an online multiplayer game of educational pictionary, which will introduce you to real-time databases and services that facilitate real-time communication between multiple users and your own backend. 

For both of these projects, I recommend starting by building a frontend in Replit, v0, or lovable, and then building the backend and additional features in your IDE. Again, we will aim to deploy the MVP of each project in less than a day. Sounds crazy? By the time you finish project 3, you won't be able to imagine building any other way.

For the first three projects, we have prepared detailed project requirements documents, which you can use to guide your learning and building, and which include strong suggestions for many of the technical decisions you will have to make.

For the last two projects, you will be more independent in defining the scope and requirements of the project and choosing the tech stack. And if you manage to pull them off and deploy them in a properly functioning state, we will reward you, but more on that later. 

Project 4 is building a podcasting database that uses AI natively to enable users to search for relevant clips from their favorite podcasts and create supercuts. This is a really valuable application that, at least right now, does not exist anywhere and could become your jumping board to starting a company. Project 5 is even more ambitious: you will attempt to build an app that uses AI to generate educational videos that are 10x better than anything out there at the moment. We have looked at many of the existing tools that claim to do this, and decided that someone with proper knowlege of AI first development could build something better than all the competition within 2 weeks. 




To get started, clone the github repository for this course, watch the video guides or just read through the written guides in the repo. Then, carrying all the momentum you are experiencing right now from deciding to take on this challenge, you should dive into the first project.
