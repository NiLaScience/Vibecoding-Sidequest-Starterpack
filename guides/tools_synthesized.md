## 1. Core Agentic Workspaces <a name="core-agentic-workspaces"></a>

### 1.1 Replit Agent <a name="replit-agent"></a>

**What it is** – An end-to-end, prompt-to-app builder. Give it a natural-language prompt, screenshot or Figma file, and the Agent scaffolds, codes, fixes bugs and deploys in the same cloud workspace.

*Note:* Uses **React + Vite** by default, which is great since it builds and deploys easily without much linter noise. Standard designs come out looking very generic, so it's important to have good design prompts.

**Highlights**
- Built-in Postgres-compatible DB, Auth, key vault and deployments.
- Screenshot-to-code and "Import from GitHub".
- Very easy to deploy, even after downloading the code and tweaking it in another IDE like Cursor.
- Full file explorer, VS-Code-style editor, terminal, and chat.
- Agent is getting increasingly more powerful and autonomous.

**Best for** – Building MVPs and prototypes. It excels at creating UI and basic CRUD functionality and ensures your app builds and runs.

**Learning Hacks**
- Since Replit apps follow a standard structure, it's a great way to learn the basics of web development. After building a prototype, download the code and ask the Cursor agent to explain the structure, individual files, and best practices.

### 1.2 Cursor IDE <a name="cursor-ide"></a>

**Tagline** – "The AI code editor." A fork of VS Code with a wide range of LLM APIs built-in. It's an excellent way to learn development basics (terminal, file explorer, Git) in a familiar environment.

*Note:* Claude 3.5 Sonnet in Cursor is where "vibecoding" hit its stride; it's great for learning at a manageable pace. Frontier models like Gemini 2.5 can be incredibly fast, which might be overwhelming for beginners as the agent takes many actions faster than you can process.

**Highlights**
- Chat & Composer modes; use `@` tags to pull in documentation, files, and other context.
- Agent Mode can browse the web, run terminal commands, and open PRs.
- Tab completion is very context-aware and fast.
- Full access to the VS Code extension marketplace.

**Learning Hacks**
- Learn to use the terminal, file explorer, and Git from within the IDE.
- Load in any project and ask the agent to explain the folder structure, individual files, and best practices to quickly get up to speed.

### 1.3 Windsurf IDE <a name="windsurf-ide"></a>

**What it is** – The first **agentic IDE**. It has its own UI and a "Cascade" engine that builds a semantic graph of your repository to perform multi-file edits and tests autonomously. The UX can feel more fluid and "vibey" than Cursor's.

*Note:* Windsurf was acquired by OpenAI, which guarantees best-in-class access to GPT models but may raise questions about neutrality. For learning traditional development workflows, Cursor's VS Code foundation is arguably still better.

**Highlights**
- Smooth UX and highly themeable UI.
- "Supercomplete" feature gives diff-style previews for suggestions.
- Very economical model options.
- On-premise and zero-retention deployment options for regulated industries.

---

### 1.4 Claude Code (CLI Agent) <a name="claude-code"></a>

**Tagline** – Anthropic's command-line coding agent. It's immensely autonomous and powerful.

*Note:* This agent can be hard for beginners to tame, and you learn less when not interacting directly with an IDE. Running it in a terminal within Cursor or Windsurf is a great way to maximize productivity while still observing its actions.

**Key Commands & Features**

| Capability | Detail / Tip |
| --- | --- |
| **Multi-file edits** | Ask it to perform complex tasks like "Update auth flow for OAuth 2.1," and it will branch, edit, commit, and open a PR. |
| **Memory Tiers** | Manages session, project (`./CLAUDE.md`), and global memory for context. |
| **Tool Palette** | Use declarative calls like `!test` or `!lint` that map to your project's scripts. |
| **Best Practices** | Keep prompts goal-oriented. Commit early and often. |

## 2. Generative UI & App Builders <a name="generative-ui-app-builders"></a>

### 2.1 Vercel v0 <a name="vercel-v0"></a>

**What it is** – An AI UI generator that turns prompts into React/Tailwind/shadcn components. It ships with code preview, a live sandbox, and 1-click Vercel deploy. Many community templates are available to get started.

*Note:* v0 will somewhat lock you into the Vercel ecosystem (Next.js, Vercel AI SDK). This is great for quickly building professional-looking prototypes, but not everyone loves Next.js, and Vercel deployments have performance limits. The v0 agent is generally less capable than Replit's for backend architecture and debugging.

- **Recommended Template:** [https://v0.dev/community/next-js-shadcn-ui-ujvXoiAFlxG](https://v0.dev/community/next-js-shadcn-ui-ujvXoiAFlxG)

**Highlights**
- Generates professional-looking UI with good customization.
- Accepts screenshots or Figma imports and generates assets on demand.
- Team sharing & fork-based collaboration.
- Integrations with GitHub and Supabase.

**Best for** – Design-heavy front-end prototyping when you still want clean, ownable code. If you like Next.js, it's a great starting point for any project.

**Learning Hacks**
- Building a Next.js app is a must for any modern developer to learn server-side rendering, client-side components, routing, etc. Build a prototype, download the code, and ask the Cursor agent to explain the structure and best practices.

## 3. Backend & Data Platforms <a name="backend-data-platforms"></a>

### 3.1 Supabase AI-Native Stack <a name="supabase"></a>

**What it is** – An AI-enhanced Postgres platform. Beyond a mere database, you can build full backend functionality with it, including auth, storage, realtime, vector search, cron jobs, and edge functions.

*Note:* Using Postgres is a great way to learn about databases and data modeling. However, if you are truly "vibecoding," you'll change your schema frequently. Managing local Docker instances with frequent migrations can be tedious compared to a cloud NoSQL database like Firebase, which allows for more flexible schema changes on the fly during development.

**Highlights**
- An essential part of the modern "AI-Native" stack.
- Great dashboard for managing your database and other services, very helpful for beginners.
- Comes with Docker for easy local development.

**Key 2025 Modules**

| Module | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| **AI Assistant v2** | Project-aware chat + inline SQL/Cron help |
| **Supabase Vecs** | pgvector + automated embedding refresh pipelines |
| **Cron** | UI for `pg_cron` to run scheduled jobs |
| **Queues** | Durable `pgmq` message queues for background tasks |
| **Edge Functions** | Deno 2.1, per-function import maps |
| **Dedicated Pooler** | Transaction-mode PgBouncer for connection management |

---

### 3.2 Firebase <a name="firebase"></a>

**What it is** – A very feature-rich platform from Google for building mobile and web apps, including a database, auth, storage, functions, hosting, and an AI agent.

*Note:* Firebase Functions are a great way to build backend logic, but deploying JS/TS functions can be slow. It's important to set up good logging and monitoring for the various services you use.

**Highlights**
- **Firestore** is an excellent, flexible NoSQL database for most applications.
- **Storage, Functions, Auth, Realtime, web and mobile app hosting** are all built in.
- **Excellent web UI and CLI** make it easy to use for all levels of developer.
- **AI Logic SDKs** (for all platforms) provide direct client access to Gemini and Imagen models, protected by App Check.
- **Gemini in Firebase** offers a console assistant, Crashlytics debugging, and more.
- **Genkit** is an open-source framework for building server-side AI orchestration.
- **Firebase Studio** is a browser-based IDE with a Gemini 2.5 prototyping agent.

## 4. Additional Tools to Watch <a name="additional-tools"></a>

| Tool | TL;DR |
| --- | --- |
| **GitHub Copilot Workspace** | Copilot-native environment to go from issue → plan → multi-file PR. |
| **Amazon Q Developer** | AWS console assistant & end-to-end code pipeline agent. |
| **Bolt.new** | In-browser IDE using WebContainers + AI for instant, full-stack runtimes. |
| **Lovable.dev** | Chat-first full-stack builder; imports Figma, integrates Supabase/GitHub. |
